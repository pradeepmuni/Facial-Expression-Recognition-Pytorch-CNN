# Facial-Expression-Recognition-Pytorch-CNN
The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. The faces have been automatically registered so that the face is more or less centered and occupies about the same amount of space in each image. The task is to categorize each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression in to one of seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral).

The dataset consists of 35,887 examples.This dataset was prepared by Pierre-Luc Carrier and Aaron Courville, as part of an ongoing research project.

We will be using Pytorch package to create the Convolutional Neural Network model to classify the images and various metrics like Confusion matrix and plots will b eused to evaluate the performance of the model and at the end we will be testing the model by few images taken from google
